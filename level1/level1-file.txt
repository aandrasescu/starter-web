Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Te salut, Don Corleone. When they come... they come at what you love. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born?

I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship.

Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. You can act like a man! My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?
